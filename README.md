# Camelus
Counts of Amplified Mass Elevations from Lensing with Ultrafast Simulation
Chieh-An Lin (CEA Saclay)
Release v1.2 - 2015-04-06

## Description

Camelus is a fast weak lensing peak count modeling in C. It provides a prediction on peak counts from input cosmological parameters.

Here is the summary of the algorithm:
  - sample halos from a mass function and assign profiles,
  - carry out ray-tracing simulations,
  - count peaks from smoothed maps.
  
For a more detailed description, please take a look at Lin & Kilbinger (2015).

## Requirements

The following softwares are required:
  - [cmake](http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
  - gcc
  - [gsl](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
  - [fftw](http://www.fftw.org/)
  - [nicaea v2.5](http://www.cosmostat.org/nicaea.html)

## Compilation

For Mac users, do the follows before compilation:
```
$ export CC=gcc
$ export CXX=g++
```
or use 'setenv' command in tcsh.

To compile the package:
```
$ export NICAEA={PATH_OF_NICAEA}/nicaea_2.5
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

To get program instructions:
```
$ ./camelus
```

## Tutorial

Go to param and modify .par files to customize parameters.

`$ ./camelus 1 z`
  This gives the values of the mass function from Jenkins et al. (2001) for M from 10^9 to 10^17 [M_sol h^2/Mpc^3].

`$ ./camelus 2`
  This yields a halo list from sampling using customized parameters.
  
`$ ./camelus 3`
  This creates a peak catalogue and its histogram of S/N values. A halo list, a galaxy list, a smoothed noise map, a smoothed noisy map will be made as well.
  
`$ ./camelus 4 N`
  This creates N independent peak lists with the same cosmology and settings from .par files. Using this command can reduce the computation time, since the cosmological computations are factorized.

`$ ./camelus 4 N Omega_m sigma_8`
  Same as above, but the inputs Omega_m and sigma_8 will overwrite the values from .par files, and creates N independent peak lists.

`$ ./camelus 5`
  ABC computation. This gives a posterior probability of Omega_m-sigma_8 constraints.
  Only this combination is available. Parameters are defined in peakParam.par. 
  This requires an observation data that we have provided an example in demo.
  Only several summary statistics are available.
